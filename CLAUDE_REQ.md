# Requirements Document - Chemistry Predictions Feature

## Introduction

BAEsed is an innovative Tinder-like, swipe-based dating mini-app built for Farcaster and Base that transforms matchmaking into a community-driven experience through Chemistry Predictions. The application features a dual-feed system where users both search for their own matches (Discovery Mode) and help predict the success of others' relationships (Chemistry Mode). By gamifying the matchmaking process through supportive community predictions rather than overt gambling mechanics, BAEsed creates an engaging ecosystem where finding love is the primary focus, with prediction rewards serving as fun bonuses for being a good wingman/wingwoman.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Onchain User Profile Creation and Management
**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create a permanent onchain profile linked to my wallet address, so that I can establish a verifiable digital identity for dating and chemistry predictions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  - "Exchange 10+ messages in 7 days" - Default: $0.50 USDC
  - "Meet up within 14 days" - Default: $1.00 USDC
  - "Go on 3+ dates in 30 days" - Default: $2.00 USDC
  - "Still chatting after 30 days" - Default: $1.50 USDC
- WHEN a user is new THEN the system SHALL limit maximum stake to $5.00 per prediction
- WHEN a user achieves Chemistry Expert status (70%+ accuracy) THEN the system SHALL unlock higher stake tiers up to $100
- WHEN placing a stake THEN the system SHALL show potential payout based on current pool ratios
- WHEN USDC allowance is insufficient THEN the system SHALL prompt for approval with clear explanation
- WHEN stake is confirmed THEN the system SHALL display transaction status with celebratory UI

### Requirement 5: Chemistry Score Visualization and Evolution
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see how the community views the chemistry between matches, so that I can make informed predictions and learn from collective wisdom.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a match has fewer than 10 predictions THEN the system SHALL display "âš¡ Chemistry Unknown"
- WHEN a match reaches 10-25 predictions THEN the system SHALL display "âš¡ Chemistry Building" with a warm glow
- WHEN a match reaches 25-50 predictions THEN the system SHALL display "âš¡ Chemistry Strong ðŸ”¥"
- WHEN a match exceeds 50 predictions THEN the system SHALL display "âš¡ Electric Chemistry âš¡"
- WHEN chemistry scores change significantly THEN the system SHALL animate the transition smoothly
- WHEN displaying scores THEN the system SHALL use warm colors for high chemistry and cool colors for low chemistry

### Requirement 6: Gamification with Real Rewards System
**User Story:** As an active predictor, I want to earn both recognition and USDC rewards for accurate predictions, building my reputation as a Chemistry Expert.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user correctly predicts 5 matches in a row THEN the system SHALL award a "Chemistry Streak" badge and 10% bonus on next stake
- WHEN a user's overall prediction accuracy exceeds 70% THEN the system SHALL grant "Chemistry Expert" status with access to higher stakes
- WHEN a prediction resolves correctly THEN the system SHALL:
  - Distribute USDC proportional to stake and pool sizes
  - Award "Vibe Points" for leaderboard ranking
  - Update accuracy percentage publicly displayed
- WHEN displaying profiles in Chemistry Mode THEN the system SHALL show total USDC earned and accuracy rate
- WHEN vibe points accumulate THEN the system SHALL unlock premium features (super likes, boost visibility)
- WHEN showing prediction results THEN the system SHALL celebrate the relationship success first, then mention USDC earned

### Requirement 7: Privacy-Conscious Prediction Interface
